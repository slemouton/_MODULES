# sigmund~ 64bit version
A 64-bit version of the popular sigmund~ object by Miller Puckette for MaxMSP. 
The original MaxMSP port by Ted Apel, which only runs in 32bit mode, can be found here http://vud.org/max/

As both APIs (PD and MaxMSP) drift away from each other quickly, it will not be possible to build for both environments from the same file anymore.
